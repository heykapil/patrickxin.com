## The Beginning

I still remember the day you come into my life. You were so tiny and frightened. 
The first time I saw you I made up my mind to give you the best and take good 
care of you. It took me about 2 hours to get you back to my house. Then you were hiding 
behind the couch, too scared to come out. I prepared food and water in front of you 
until you got used to the new smell. Yes, the smell is all for you. Gradually, You came to me cautiously and realized 
I'm not a threat. You began to explore your new territory. I wasn't a cat lover at 
first and I had no idea how to raise a cat. I'd done tons of research about how to
feed a baby cat like you, what to do and what not to do. After staying in the room for
two days, you decided to come downstairs. That's the first time you try to walk on stairs.
Then you fully adjusted yourself to the new environment. You know that I'm the one who cares
you, treasure you and protect you.

## The Happiness and the pain

You are the cuties cat ever. You can understand what I'm saying, you will roll yourself
on the floor whenever I come back, you play with me as if I'm your prey. I'm not your master, on the contrary, you're mine. You travelled with me wherever I went, Vancouver, Nanaimo, Comox, and Victoria.
You are still scared to stay in the kennel, but as soon as you saw me, I could feel the safety in your eyes.
We're never separated, you always wait for me at the door, you sleep with me between my legs. I love
you so much that I barely move in case of waking you up. I roll my body so slightly that
you don't even bother to move. I tell you all my feelings, happiness, sadness, sorrow, nostalgia. I talk with you
about how I solve the problems when I'm coding. You are my Rubber Duck. I have a sense that you understand me.
because you are the smartest. 

You have suffered from losing your nails, and straining to pee. I could not imagine how much
pain you endured. The uncomfort written on your face is the sharpest knife ripped into my heart.
You never refuses to take pills. You just lie around my arm waiting for me to sanitize your wounds.
Fortunately, you recovered quickly both times.

For me, you are not a pet, you are my family.

## The End
 
Can't believe tonight is the last night I stay with you. Last time you sleep beside me. Last time I clean
the litter for you. Tomorrow morning it will be the last time I hold you on my shoulder,
the last time I feed you. I wish time could stop at this moment for just you and me. Let the eternity
stay for just tonight.

You will soon begin your new life, a life without me. It's a shame that I can't be your mate anymore.
I pray to god from the bottom of my heart that they will treat you thousands of millions of times better than me.
You must grow vigorously like before, try not to bite your little nails, eat as much as you want. 

I will never forget you and never adopt another cat, you'll always be the only one. Farewell, Alex!
