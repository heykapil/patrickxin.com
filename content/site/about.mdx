<h3 className="lg:text-3xl text-gradient my-6">About Me</h3>
Hello, I'm Patrick Xin. I'm passionate about creating beautiful, user-friendly websites.
I started my coding journey shortly before the pandemic began. I immediately fell
in love with React and NextJS. Since then, I've got myself familiar with the technologies
like Typescript, Prisma, GraphQL, StyledComponent, TailwindCSS, etc.. My goal is
to become a full-stack software engineer and have my own start-up.

I've decide to regularly write posts, sharing my daily life as well as web technology, you are very welcome to leave a comment or email me.

Right now I'm learning Web3 and Blockchain.
