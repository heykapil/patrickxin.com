## Hello World

Hi there! Welcome to my site!

After a long time of designing and developing, I'm so excited to launch my personal space on the Internet.
A palce where I can share my thoughts, ideas, and knowledge of web development, as well as my daily life.

In the comments section, you're very welcome to drop a comment. Any suggestion, feedback is apperaicated.

Building a blog website is not as hard as before. There are tons of resources out there to reference. I always want
to build an unique website that I can communite with others. I put everthing I've learnt together to build this. Hope you
like it just as I do.

I will continue to write posts about how I developed this website step by step. Here are some basic
info about this website.


## Tech Stack
- [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org/) as framework
- Style with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- MDX with [ContentLayer](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer) 
- [ReactQuery](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) for client side data fetching
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) as ORM
- Animation with [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/docs/animation/)
- [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/) as DB



## Features
- Each post views will update automatically after a visit.
- Vistors can like, comment post, the only requirement is a valid email.
- There is Admin role in DB, where users can be deleted. I implemented authorization using
`jwt` and `_middleware` in [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org/docs/middleware). As an admin, you can also
 see website performance, views, likes, comments and users.

## Todos
- As traffic increases, I may use NextAuth for Github authtication.
- Add reply functionality to admin page so that I can easily interact with my commentors.


## Running locally
Connection to PlanetScale is not required as long as you have your local databse setup, then run `prisma migrate dev`. If you want to create an Admin role, simply uncomment the code inside `pages/api/auth/login`, after you see your admin user in [Prisma Studio](https://www.prisma.io/studio), comment it back.
